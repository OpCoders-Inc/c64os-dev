# headconv
This tool can be used to convert the include headers for [C64 OS](https://c64os.com/).

The tool is a python script that does not need any external libraries to run, so it should be relatively easy to setup and run.

Most people will never need to use this tool because it is for the developers who are doing cross system development for C64 OS and need the headers for assembling.
