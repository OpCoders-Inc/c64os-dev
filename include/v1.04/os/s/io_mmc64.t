;MMC64 uses Serial Peripheral Interface
;(SPI) for communications with MMC and
;SD Cards, and also with an RTC chip.

;MMC64 Registers

;MMC64 Identity Register Values

;Read if MMC64 is present and enabled.

mmi_revb = $02 ;Card not selected, Rev.B

;Write mmi_unl1 then write mmi_unl2 to
;unlock. Then write mcr_dact to mmc_ctl
;to disable MMC64 without unplugging it.

mmi_unl1 = %01010101 ;Unlock Stage 1

;When MMC64 has been disabled, write
;mmi_ena1 then write mmi_ena2 to mmc_idy
